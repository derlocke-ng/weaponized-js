# Architecture

How weaponized.js moves and stores data, why it stopped using gun, and where it is going. This is the record of the decisions made in October 2026; update it when a decision changes.

## Decision: nostr + Blossom, not gun

The first versions of every tool here ran on [gun.js](https://gun.eco). It worked, but:

- **gun is barely maintained** — one release in two years, and bugs (offline writes never replayed, `user.auth` races) had to be worked around in every app.
- **Relays forget.** gun relays are caches with no retention promise and no way to ask "what do you still have?", so every app had to carry its own heal-and-backup machinery.
- **No story for pictures or feeds.** A grow diary with photos (Outpost) or a chat (Uplink) needs blob storage and query-by-author/tag/time, which gun's graph does not give.
- **One implementation.** If gun's relay code breaks, every relay breaks with it.

[nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips) fixes all four with less code on our side:

- Everything is a **signed JSON event**. Relays verify signatures, so forgery is rejected at the door and any device can re-publish any event it holds (healing needs no special trust).
- **Replaceable and addressable events** (kinds 30000–39999 with a `d` tag) give us "newest version of this thing" for free; **ephemeral events** (20000–29999) give us signaling that relays never store.
- **Filters** (`authors`, `kinds`, `#d`, `since`) let a device ask for exactly what it is missing.
- **Many relays, many implementations** (strfry, nostr-rs-relay, khatru…), run by many people. Users pick theirs; we can run some as a [kiwi-network](https://github.com/derlocke-ng) module; nothing of ours is a single point of failure.
- **[Blossom](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom)** servers store blobs by SHA-256, authorised by nostr keys — pictures and file drops without inventing storage.
- Relays also don't promise retention — nostr is not a blockchain — so the local-first design below stays: **every device is the source of truth for its own data**, relays are the transport and the cache.

Costs accepted: nostr relays see the same metadata gun relays saw (who writes which addresses when, from which IP). Content is encrypted before it leaves the device, always.

## The shared core (`apps/shared/`)

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `nostr.mjs` | nostr-tools 2.25 + noble crypto, bundled by `scripts/vendor.mjs` (esbuild). The only third-party code in the core. |
| `events.js` | Kind numbers, event helpers (`makeAddressable`, `sign`, `stamp`), AES-GCM content encryption (`seal` / `open`), HKDF key derivation. |
| `store.js` | `LocalStore`: IndexedDB (`wjs`) with the device's copy of every event it cares about, an outbox of events not yet accepted by each relay, and small metadata. |
| `relays.js` | `RelayPool`: the user's relay list (`localStorage` `wjs.relays`), connections with ping/reconnect, latency, NIP-11 info (name, country) for the server picker, publish to all with per-relay results, de-duplicated subscriptions. |
| `account.js` | Device key, username + password accounts (below), nsec / ncryptsec import and export. |
| `sync.js` | `Sync`: publish = store locally + send to every relay + queue what failed; flush the outbox on (re)connect; heal relays with the device's copy of watched authors. |
| `util.js` | base64url, ids, safe `localStorage`. |

Apps import these as ES modules; nothing is built except the vendored bundle. Each app's service worker caches `../shared/` too, so the suite works offline.

## Identity and accounts

**Every device has a key** (secp256k1, generated on first visit, kept in `localStorage` as `wjs.identity`). With nothing else, a device already works: its boards are published under this key and encrypted to it.

**An account is a username and a password**, implemented on plain nostr events without any registry or name uniqueness:

```
salt      = sha256('wjs/account/v1|' + normalize(username))
seed      = scrypt(password, salt, N = 2^16, r = 8, p = 1, dkLen = 64)
lookupSk  = seed[0..32]        → a nostr key pair that only this username+password can derive
wrapKey   = seed[32..64]       → encrypts the real key

account event: kind 30790, d = 'account', signed by lookupSk,
               content = seal(wrapKey, { v: 1, sk: <device secret key>, alias })
```

Sign-in derives the same lookup key, asks the relays for `{ kinds: [30790], authors: [lookupPk] }` and decrypts. Properties:

- **Nobody can find, squat, spam or overwrite an account without the password.** The lookup pubkey is unguessable, and relays only accept the event from its own key. Two people choosing the same username get two unrelated events — no uniqueness to fight over, nothing to DoS.
- **Offline brute force** is possible for anyone who already has the event (they'd have to find it first): scrypt 2^16 makes guesses slow; passwords are at least 10 characters; there is no reset.
- Signing in on a device that already had boards **carries them into the account** (the device's key is replaced by the account's; its events are re-published under the new key).
- The usual nostr logins exist too: paste an `nsec`, hex key or `ncryptsec` (NIP-49). NIP-07 (browser extension) and NIP-46 (remote signer) are planned but not built.

Each app derives its own keys from the account key with HKDF labels (`wjs/self`, `wjs/loadout/read`, …), so a leak of one app's key never exposes another's.

## Content encryption

NIP-44 caps payloads at 64 KB and is built for two-party messages, so content uses WebCrypto directly:

```
key      = HKDF-SHA256(secret, info = label, 32 bytes)
payload  = base64url( version || iv(12) || AES-256-GCM(key, iv, body, aad = version) )
version  = 0x01: body is UTF-8 JSON     0x02: body is gzip(JSON)   (gzip when JSON > 1 KB)
```

Everything in an event's `content` is a sealed payload; tags carry only the `d` address and a version. Relays and crawlers see sizes, timestamps and addresses, nothing else.

## Event kinds

| Kind | Name | Type | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30700 | `LOADOUT_WALLET` | addressable | one entry per board in a user's wallet; `d` = sha256 slot of the board pubkey |
| 30701 | `LOADOUT_INFO` | addressable | board title, type, mode (`d` = `info`) |
| 30702 | `LOADOUT_ITEM` | addressable | one list / inventory item per event (`d` = item id); `{ del: 1 }` is a tombstone |
| 30703 | `LOADOUT_DOC` | addressable | the markdown note of a board (`d` = `doc`) |
| 30790 | `ACCOUNT` | addressable | username + password account (above) |
| 30791 | `SETTINGS` | addressable | per-app settings, encrypted to the user's key; `d` = app name (Loadout: starters and their templates; DevBoard: saved notes) |
| 30810 | `DEVBOARD_POST` | addressable | a public DevBoard note: `d` per note, NIP-40 `expiration`, one `t` tag per skill, NIP-13 `nonce`; JSON content `{ type, title, text, tags, rate, contact }` or `{ del: 1 }` as a tombstone |
| 21700 | `P2P_PRESENCE` | ephemeral | Payload / pong room presence — planned |
| 21701 | `P2P_SIGNAL` | ephemeral | encrypted WebRTC offers / answers / ICE — planned |
| 21702 | `P2P_DATA` | ephemeral | encrypted data frames when WebRTC fails — planned |

Addressable events replace by `(kind, pubkey, d)` with the newest `created_at` winning. `created_at` has one-second resolution, so `stamp(address)` hands out a strictly increasing timestamp per address on each device; two devices editing within the same second still tie-break deterministically (lowest id), which is the same rule relays apply.

## Local first, offline, heal, backup

1. **Every write goes to IndexedDB first**, then to every connected relay. Relays that were offline or rejected the event for a transient reason get it from the **outbox** when they next connect.
2. **Reads come from IndexedDB** and are updated by live subscriptions; the UI never waits for a relay.
3. **Heal.** On every relay (re)connect each device re-publishes its copy of every "watched" author (its own key, its account event, every board in its wallet), throttled to once per 30 minutes per relay and author. Relays treat duplicates as no-ops and newer versions as replacements, so healing is idempotent and can never roll back an edit. A relay that lost its disk is repaired by the first device that reconnects.
4. **Backups** are the raw signed events of everything the user owns plus a readable snapshot, encrypted (AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2-SHA-256 600 000 rounds) with a passphrase. Restoring re-publishes the events, so even the account itself comes back after every relay and every device is gone.

Data is lost only if every device that ever held it is gone *and* there is no backup.

## Decided for the social layer

- **Friends are mutual**: request and accept, both sides hold each other, delivered as gift wraps so relays see neither who asked nor who answered. The list itself is an encrypted event under the user's key; nostr's public follow list is never used. Each person has a friends key for friends-only content, handed to friends privately and rotated when someone is removed.
- **Marketplace listings carry coarse plaintext tags**: category, seller country and shipping destinations (country codes, `EU`, worldwide, pickup only), so relays can filter and a phone downloads only what applies to it. Everything else in a listing is encrypted. Accepted trade-off: relays learn that some key lists seeds in a country.
- **Device settings are site-wide**: language (`wjs.lang`) and theme (`wjs.theme`) are chosen on the hub or in any app and apply everywhere, live across tabs through the storage event. They stay on the device; account settings (kind 30791) are for things that should follow the account.

## Moderation

nostr has no central moderation; it has three layers, and the suite uses all three:

- **Your block list** (NIP-51 mute list, kind 10000). Ours keeps every entry in the encrypted private part, so relays and other people never learn who you blocked; other nostr clients that know your key read the same list. Apps consult it before showing a post, accepting a message or a friend request: blocked people cannot write to you, cannot add you, and their Outpost posts and listings stay out of your feeds. Managed in the settings; later also from a post or profile with one tap.
- **Reports** (NIP-56, kind 1984): "spam", "illegal", "impersonation", "nudity", "malware", "profanity" or "other", about a person or one event, with an optional note. Reports are public, signed by the reporter, and go to the relays: relay operators act on them (strfry policies, bans), and clients can hide what many people they trust reported. Outpost gets a report action on posts and listings.
- **Relay policy**: each relay decides what it stores and who may write (rate limits, bans, allow-lists); the kiwi `weaponized` relay will ship with a sane policy and read reports.

`apps/shared/moderation.js` holds the list and the report builder.

## Languages

Every app ships its strings as one JSON catalog per language (`apps/<app>/locales/<lang>.json`) plus a shared catalog for common words and the core's error messages (`apps/shared/locales/`). `apps/shared/i18n.js` loads the active language and English as the fallback, nothing else, so a device downloads one small file per app (10–20 KB) and caches it offline.

- **Choice.** The browser's language list picks the first supported language. A browser set to a supported non-English language gets the app in that language straight away plus a one-time banner, in that language, to keep it or pick another. English browsers are never asked. The choice is stored on the device only (`wjs.lang`), with a selector in the settings; the shell step moves it into the suite settings.
- **Content.** Plural forms follow CLDR categories through `Intl.PluralRules` (Polish needs `few`/`many`), dates and relative times through `Intl.DateTimeFormat` / `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`. Shared code throws errors with a stable `code` and the UI translates by code (`tErr`), so the core never contains UI language.
- **Languages.** English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Polish and Portuguese, the EU's big languages plus the UK, US and Canada. More are one JSON file each; a unit test checks that every language has every key with the same placeholders, markup and plural forms. Translations are machine-drafted and reviewed, corrections welcome by pull request.
- **Region is separate from language.** Country for the marketplace and the legal declaration come from settings, never from the UI language.

## Design library

Every page looks and navigates the same because every page uses the same pieces from `apps/shared/`:

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `ui.css` | tokens (light, dark, explicit theme), base styles, buttons, inputs, forms, segmented control, cards, banners, modal, menu, toasts |
| `ui.js` | `$`, `$$`, `h()` escaping, `icon()`, `toast()`, `modal()`, `confirmDialog()`, `copyText()`, `download()` |
| `topbar.js/.css` | the top bar: switcher button, brand, right-hand slot; one height everywhere |
| `switcher.js/.css` | the app sheet: start page, apps not hidden, settings; hardware back closes it |
| `appshell.js` | `initAppShell()`: theme, language, top bar and the account's hidden apps / language / theme in one call |
| `theme.js`, `i18n.js`, `settings.js` | the device and account settings behind it |

An app plugs in with three lines: `@import url('../shared/ui.css')` at the top of its stylesheet, `<header id="top"></header>` at the top of its body, and `await initAppShell({ current, brand, right })` before it draws. The icon sprites come from `scripts/vendor.mjs` (lucide). Payload and pongjs are on it already; pongjs keeps its CRT look by giving the library its own token values.

## One account for the suite

The hub (the installed app's start page) and every app share one origin, so `localStorage` holds one identity (`wjs.identity`) and IndexedDB one event store for all of them. Signing in or creating an account on the hub switches that identity; `adoptIdentity()` keeps the previous key aside and each app carries its own data over on its next start (`previousIdentities()` / `markCarried()`): Loadout re-publishes the wallet entries of the old device key under the account key. Signing in inside an app does the same. Nothing is lost by signing in late.

Publishing is local-first and never blocks the UI: an event is stored, marked pending for every relay, and sent; relays acknowledge in the background and leave the outbox as they do. Only the account event waits, and only for the first relay that accepts it, because other devices must be able to find it.

## Relays and servers

The default relay list is a handful of large public relays. The settings screen shows each relay's latency and its NIP-11 name and country, lets users add their own (including a `ws://localhost` dev relay), and is the seed of the **server picker**: choose relays by speed and jurisdiction, same for Blossom and TURN once those are in.

A `weaponized` kiwi-network module (strfry relay + blossom-server + coturn, `module.yaml` + `docker-compose.yml.j2`) will let any kiwi-master or kiwi-node host the whole stack; the apps then list those servers first. Nothing in the apps depends on a server of ours existing.

`scripts/nostr-relay.mjs` is a small spec-conformant relay (NIP-01 + NIP-11, JSONL storage) used by the tests and for development.

## Loadout on nostr

A board is a nostr key pair. Whoever has the secret key (`?w=`) can publish `30701/30702/30703` events for it — relays reject anything else, so write protection is the relay's signature check. The read key is `HKDF(w, 'wjs/loadout/read')`; view links carry only that (`?k=`), so viewers can decrypt but not sign. Without a key the board shows as locked, and the relay only ever holds ciphertext — the e2e test verifies both.

Items are one event each (not one blob per board), so two people editing different items never conflict and a device only transfers what changed. Deleting a board publishes a tombstone `info` and strips its items; wallets of other devices drop it via their own tombstone entries.

## DevBoard

The freelancer noticeboard is public by nature, so its defence is not encryption but cost and consensus, applied by every reader (`apps/devboard/`):

- **A note** is a kind 30810 event (see the table) that lives 24 hours to 30 days; relays drop it at `expiration`, readers drop it even if a relay does not. Editing republishes under the same `d`; deleting publishes a `{ "del": 1 }` tombstone that supersedes the note and is kept in memory so an older copy cannot resurrect it.
- **Proof of work** (NIP-13): 20 leading zero bits per note, mined in a web worker (`pow-worker.js`, a few seconds on a phone); 12 bits per vote or report. Events below the bar are not shown, whatever a relay accepted. The bar is a constant in the client, so a relay policy can enforce the same numbers server-side later (strfry plugin).
- **Three live notes per person**; the newest three count and the rest collapse. **Votes** are NIP-25 reactions with `+`/`-`, one per person and note (the newest wins, empty content takes it back), capped at ten per half minute per device. A note at −5 collapses; so does one that three or more people reported (NIP-56, with the note's address). Collapsed notes can be opened anyway; your own never collapse for you.
- **The suite's moderation applies**: a blocked person's notes, votes and reports vanish on every device (encrypted NIP-51 list), and blocking is one tap from any note. Saved notes are account settings (kind 30791, `d` = `devboard`).
- **Contact** is whatever the poster wrote (mail, handle, npub), shown only on request, with a reminder to check who you are talking to; Uplink becomes the in-app path once it exists.

## Roadmap

1. ~~Shared core; Loadout on nostr~~ (done — `test/e2e/loadout.mjs` runs 17 multi-device scenarios against the dev relay, including two relay wipes).
2. **Payload and pongjs on nostr**: presence and signaling as ephemeral events 21700–21702 (encrypted to the room secret), data frames over 21702 when WebRTC fails, TURN servers from the picker; Payload gets a **drop** mode — encrypted chunks on a Blossom server with an expiry — for receivers who are not online right now. Then gun, `apps/shared/gun.js` and `scripts/relay.cjs` go.
3. **Uplink** (chat): NIP-17 private messages between accounts, ephemeral encrypted rooms (what EnigmaJS did), groups later.
4. **Outpost** (grow reports): entries and photos encrypted before upload to Blossom, friends list, visibility layers (private / friends / "public" = readable by anyone signed into the app), feed and explore; marketplace for seeds, cuttings and gear behind an 18+ / legal-region declaration and a no-liability agreement. Cuttings are an ordinary category everywhere: whether a listing is legal where the user lives is the user's call under that agreement, not the software's. Backups include blobs.
5. **Suite shell**: one account for every app, app switcher, hidden apps and language in settings (kind 30791), People and Circles.
6. **kiwi `weaponized` module**; replace the first default relays with kiwi ones.
7. ~~DevBoard on nostr~~ (done — see *DevBoard* above; `test/e2e/devboard.mjs` covers notes, votes, reports, blocking and the cap on two devices). Still to come for it: a relay policy that enforces the same proof of work and caps server-side, and trust-weighted report counts once People and Circles exist.

Open: contact path for marketplace listings (in-app Uplink vs. external), which public Blossom servers accept encrypted blobs.
